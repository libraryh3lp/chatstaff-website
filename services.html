        Chatstaff's primary service offering has always been chat reference,
        but like any group of experienced librarians our team has many more
        skills to offer as well. Some of the more common requests are included
        below, but if there's something you need that's not listed here, we
        encourage you to
        <a href="mailto:info@chatstaff.org">email us</a> about it.

        Our experienced librarians aim to give your patrons an experience as close to what they'd get from you as possible.  We value feedback and encourage you to review transcripts via the <a href="https://libraryh3lp.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">LibraryH3lp dashboard</a>.  
<br>We can easily integrate with your local chat software be it LibraryH3lp, LibChat/LibAnswers, RefChatter, or another product.

        A well-populated list of Frequently Asked Questions can be a real time saver for patrons, but takes time to create and mtaintain.  Chatstaff can help with both stages by first starting with a list of questions that are pretty universally asked, then regularly reviewing transcripts of chats with your patrons for new potential entries.

        There probably aren't many libarians who went into the field because they love statistics, but numbers and analysis are frequently needed to support funding requests and accreditation. Chat reference can provide a wealth of documented information about usage. Chatstaff can perform custom analysis of keywords, origin points, overall patterns, etc., with tables and graphs formatted to fit your needs.

      <h2>Backup Coverage</h2>

        Because Chatstaff's partnership with LibraryH3lp allows us to offer automatic, seamless backup options, you don't have to choose between local expertise and constant availability. If you use different software locally, it's still entirely possible to have Chatstaff as backup.

        We can help enter your chat data into statistics modules like LibAnalytics & DeskStats! Just give us the metric you want used for evaluation and access to your system, and we can enter your chats on a daily basis.
