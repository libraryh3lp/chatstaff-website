        Chatstaff's primary service offering has always been chat reference,
        but like any group of experienced librarians our team also has many other
        skills to offer. Some of the more common requests are included
        below, but if there's something you need that's not listed here, please
        <a href="mailto:info@chatstaff.org">email us</a> about it, and let us help you!

      <h2>Chat Coverage</h2>

      </div>
      <p class="left">
        Our experienced librarians aim to give your patrons an experience as close to what they'd get from you as possible.  We value feedback and encourage you to review transcripts via the <a href="https://libraryh3lp.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">LibraryH3lp dashboard</a>.  
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Chatstaff can easily integrate with your local chat software, whether it be LibraryH3lp, LibChat/LibAnswers, RefChatter, or another product.

        Make & Maintain FAQs
      </h2>
      <div class="dotted_line">

      <p class="left">
        A well-populated list of Frequently Asked Questions can be a real time saver for patrons, but takes time to create and maintain.  
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Whether you just want a list of common FAQ to get started, or an ongoing analysis of your chats for customized questions, we can help!  We can also generate the answers for you, so you don't have to do anything.
<!--        We can help with both stages by first starting with a list of questions that are pretty universally asked, then regularly reviewing transcripts of chats with your patrons for new potential entries.  We can also either turn those lists over to you, or create the entries ourselves so that all you have to do is review them.-->

        Marketing evaluations, funding requests, and even accreditation are all supported by good statisitical analysis, and fortunately chat reference can provide a wealth of detailed, documented information about usage.
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Chatstaff can perform custom analysis of keywords, origin points, overall patterns, etc. for you, and provide you with tables and graphs formatted to fit your needs.

      <h2>As-Needed Chat Coverage</h2>
      <div class="dotted_line">
      </div>
      <p class="left">
        It's said that the only constant is change.  Between special events, people calling in sick, and just general library chaos, that saying is all-too-true of coverage schedules.
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        No matter what software you use, Chatstaff can be available to handle your patrons the second you log off.  On top of that, if you use LibraryH3lp or Refchatter then it can be set up so that even if you're logged in, chats get sent to us once it looks like you can't pick up.

    Website Checking

  Do you have broken links on your site or in your guides, or urgent announcements of events that ended a year ago?  It's easy to just not notice such things when you have so much going on.
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        We'll always let you know what we happen to notice, but if you want a systematic check to prepare for the start of the semester, we can do that as well!  If given access, we can even make basic corrections.

      <div class="dotted_line">

<p class="left">    
        Do you want your chat data inserted into an in-house statistics module like LibAnalytics & DeskStats?
</p>
      <p class="left">
        We can do that for you!  We can do as much or as little processing as you want - Just give us the metric you use for evaluation and access to your system, and we can enter your chats on a daily basis.  If you have other data you need processed/analyzed by your metric, we can do that as well.
