        Chatstaff's primary service offering has always been chat reference,
        but like any group of experienced librarians our team has many more
        skills to offer as well. Some of the more common requests are included
        below, but if there's something you need that's not listed here, we
        encourage you to
        <a href="mailto:info@chatstaff.org">email us</a> about it.

        Our experienced librarians aim to give your patrons an experience as close to what they'd get from you as possible.  We value feedback and encourage you to review transcripts via the <a href="https://libraryh3lp.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">LibraryH3lp dashboard</a>.  
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Chatstaff can easily integrate with your local chat software, whether it be LibraryH3lp, LibChat/LibAnswers, RefChatter, or another product.

        A well-populated list of Frequently Asked Questions can be a real time saver for patrons, but takes time to create and maintain.  
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Whether you just want a list of common FAQ to get started, or an ongoing analysis of your chats for customized questions, we can help!  We can also generate the answers for you, so you don't have to do anything.
<!--        We can help with both stages by first starting with a list of questions that are pretty universally asked, then regularly reviewing transcripts of chats with your patrons for new potential entries.  We can also either turn those lists over to you, or create the entries ourselves so that all you have to do is review them.-->

        Marketing evaluations, funding requests, and even accreditation are all supported by good statisitical analysis, and fortunately chat reference can provide a wealth of detailed, documented information about usage.
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        If desired, Chatstaff can perform custom analysis of keywords, origin points, overall patterns, etc. for you, and provide you with tables and graphs formatted to fit your needs.

      <p class="left">
        Schedules change, sometimes at the last minute.  No matter what software you use, Chatstaff can be available to handle your patrons the second you log off.  On top of that, if you use LibraryH3lp or Refchatter then it can be set up so that even if you don't log out, chats get sent to Chatstaff once it looks like you can't pick up.
<!--        Because Chatstaff's partnership with LibraryH3lp allows us to offer automatic, seamless backup options, you don't have to choose between local expertise and constant availability. If you use different software locally, it's still entirely possible to have Chatstaff as backup. -->
