Welcome to Chatstaff!  We look forward to working with your library and patrons.      </p>
      
      <p>
        Setting up service requires the following steps.
      </p>
	    <p>
		    1. If you do not have an existing LibraryH3lp software subscription, please complete their <a href="https://libraryh3lp.com/free-trial" target="_blank">free trial form</a>.
      <p>
        The service is owned and run by four librarians who have over 60 years combined professional expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alicia Wyatt works closely with our customer libraries to customize our approach and provide a seamless experience for their patrons - many patrons never realize that the librarian theyâ€™re working with is from Chatstaff instead of a local!  Elizabeth Bollinger supervises and provides support for the team of incredible librarians who are the foundation of our service.  Alicia and Elizabeth both also regularly participate in staffing the service, which keeps us in tune with service on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gwen Exner and Pam Sessoms handle data wrangling, and provide development and support for the underlying software.
