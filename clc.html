<h2>Welcome to Chatstaff!  We look forward to working with your library and patrons.</h2></p>
        </div> 

	    <p>Chatstaff is a North Carolina-based, woman-owned company providing chat reference staffing.  Our professional librarians hold MLS and equivalent degrees from ALA-accredited programs across the country and are experienced navigating libraries' websites, connecting patrons with the resources offered by their libraries.  We ask each of our libraries to complete a profile (data sheet) with links and quick facts about the library in order to help us better serve your patrons.
	      <p>
	    
	    <p>
Our offering to CLC members is for chat reference coverage on the following schedule :
	         <ul style="list-style-type:circle;"> 
<li>Monday-Friday: midnight-8am and 5pm-midnight</li>
	<li>Saturday-Sunday: midnight-midnight (all day)</li>
</ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    Pricing is based on FTE (academic libraries) or service population (public libraries) and is available behind login on the <a href="https://www.ctlibrarians.org/bidcontracts" target="_blank">CLC member website</a>. </p>
<p>	    Our librarians use LibraryH3lp chat software to provide chat services to your patrons.  The LibraryH3lp chat box is an easy to use interface that can be integrated into websites, guides, and databases.  Your local staff can also use the LibraryH3lp account to staff chat locally.  If you use a different chat software locally, LibraryH3lp can become the offline message for your chat.  
</p>
