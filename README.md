# chatstaff-website

Rendered version is at:  https://libraryh3lp.github.io/chatstaff-website/

Changes to the code repo take a couple of minutes to show up in rendered version.

We'll eventually publish this site on one of the web servers (A2/OVH).  There will be a couple of simple commands to issue from the web server to grab the latest site from this GitHub repo so that the public-facing site at https://chatstaff.org/ updates.  None of that is in place yet as of 6/13/2019 so there is no risk of hurting anything on the public-facing real chatstaff.org site right now.
