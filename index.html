        Chatstaff is not a co-op. You never need to contribute coverage for other libraries in order to receive coverage.

        Already have your own co-op? BYO co-ops work seamlessly. Home Team First routing keeps it local when your co-op is online, and Chatstaff has your back when it is not.

        Tired of 2 minute wait times? Today’s online patrons don’t want to wait for a response, and often leave if the wait seems too long.
      </p>

      <p class="left">
        That’s why Chatstaff is careful to keep staffing levels high enough to maintain an average wait time of less than 12 seconds.

        Our mix-and-match approach lets you pick whatever schedule you want, and our prices are based on traffic. Want help with analytics or FAQ maintenance? We can do that too!
